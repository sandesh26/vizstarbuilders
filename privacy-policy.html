        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="muted">Effective date: 19 November 2025</p>

        <p>At Vizstar Builders ("we", "our" or "us") we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the
            personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use
            it, with whom we may share it, and your choices regarding that information when you use our website.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information you provide directly:</strong> When you contact us using the contact form or by
                email, you may provide information such as your name, email address, phone number and message. We use
                this information to respond to your inquiry.</li></br>
            <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> We do not collect usage data about visitors to this website. We do not
                track page views, store IP addresses, or record browsing behaviour for analytics or profiling purposes.
            </li></br>
            <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> We (and third-party services we use) may place
                cookies and similar technologies on your device to provide features, analytics and advertising. See the
                Cookies section below for details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may use information we collect for purposes including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Responding to and managing your inquiries and requests;</li>
            <li>Providing, maintaining and improving the website and our services;</li>
            <li>Detecting and preventing fraud or abusive behavior;</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations;</li>
            <li>Analyzing site usage and performance to understand how users interact with our content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third parties who perform services on our behalf (for example,
                hosting providers, email/SMTP providers, analytics or security vendors). These providers only receive
                the data necessary to perform their services and are contractually restricted from using it for other
                purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> When required by law, or to respond to lawful requests by public
                authorities (e.g., to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies to collect analytics or behavioural data. The site may use
            strictly necessary cookies set by third-party services only if required for a specific feature, but we do
            not use cookies for profiling or advertising.</p>

        <h2>5. Analytics</h2>
        <p>We do not use third-party analytics services and do not collect aggregated or individual analytics data. If
            this changes in future, we will update this policy and provide opt-out instructions.</p>

        <h2>6. Email and Contact Forms</h2>
        <p>Contact form submissions are delivered to our configured email address(es) and are retained for the purpose
            of communicating with you and responding to your request. We store the form data on our server logs (for
            troubleshooting and audit). If we send emails using third-party SMTP/transactional providers, those
            providers will receive the content necessary to deliver the message.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy or as
            required by law. If you would like us to delete your personal data, contact us using the details below and
            we will respond in line with applicable laws.</p>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal information. However, no
            system can be 100% secure — if you suspect that your information has been compromised, please contact us
            immediately.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to
            access, correct, delete or object to processing. To exercise these rights, please contact us at the email
            below.</p>

        <h2>10. Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>Our website may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of
            third-party sites. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any site you visit.</p>

        <h2>11. Children</h2>
        <p>Our website is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
            children under that age. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us
            to request deletion.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be posted here with an updated
            effective date.</p>
